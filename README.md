# Toy RL agents for qubit state preparation


This repository contains some jupyter notebooks that train an RL (policy gradient) agent to prepare quantum states using JAX, and visualize the learned solution on the Bloch sphere. 

Required packages:
* [jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* jupyter lab
* ipywidgets
